## Instructions
1. You need to install a server. In my case I have used json server.
2. The ReactJS client by default will expect to connect using the http://localhost:3001 to get the information.
3. The server is not provided in the git repository.
4. For the streaming I use OBS and RTMP server with Node Media Server.
